# 2    Unit Conversion
It has been deﬁned by the US government that 1 inch equals to 2.54 centimeters, and 1 foot is 12 inches.  
Your program should read in an integer that represents a length expressed in meters, and then convert it to US customary units of feet and inches. Typical program inputs and outputs are shown below.

```
Input length in meters: 3952 
Length in US customary units: 12965 feet 10 inches 
```
```
Input length in meters: 8848 
Length in US customary units: 29028 feet 10 inches
```
