# 1     Solving Linear System
A linear system is given below. please write a program to find its solution, using kramer's rule.

\\[ 3a + 4b + 5c + 6d + 7e =78\\]
\\[ 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e =50 \\] 
\\[c + 2d + 3e =25 \\] 
\\[2d + 9e =46 \\] 
\\[3d +  e =19 \\]

Note that the solution of a two-variable system is known. For example, Given the system below

\\[ ax  + by =c \\]
\\[ dx  + ey =f \\]

The solution is


\\[ x = \frac{ce - bf}{ae - bd} \\]
\\[ y = \frac{af - cd}{ae - bd} \\]


So you can use the above rule to solve `d` and `e` first, and than solve `c`, `b` and finally `a`. After finding the solution, please verify its correctness. That is, substitute the solution found to the left-hand side of the linear syste and print out the right-hand side numbers. These numbers should match with those given above. The output of your program should have the following format:
```c
Solution:
  a=x b=xxx c=x d=x e=x
Verification:
  3a+ 4b+ 5c+ 6d+ 7e= 78
      2b+ 3c+ 4d+ 5e= 50
           c+ 2d+ 3e= 25
              2d+ 9e= 46
              3d+  e= 19
```
