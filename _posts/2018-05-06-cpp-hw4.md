# 1     Deciperhing Roman Numerals
Roman numerals is a number system used in ancient Rome to represent integer numbers. In this system, seven letters are used. The letters and their values are shown in the following table.

|Letter   |I   |V   |X   |L   |C   |D   |M  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Value   |1   |5   |10   |50   |100   |500   |1000   |

Note that the solution of a two-variable system is known. For example, Given the system below

\\[ ax  + by =c \\]
\\[ dx  + ey =f \\]

The solution is


\\[ x = \frac{ce - bf}{ae - bd} \\]
\\[ y = \frac{af - cd}{ae - bd} \\]


So you can use the above rule to solve `d` and `e` first, and than solve `c`, `b` and finally `a`. After finding the solution, please verify its correctness. That is, substitute the solution found to the left-hand side of the linear system and print out the right-hand side numbers. These numbers should match with those given above. The output of your program should have the following format:
```c
Solution:
  a=x b=xxx c=x d=x e=x
Verification:
  3a+ 4b+ 5c+ 6d+ 7e= 78
      2b+ 3c+ 4d+ 5e= 50
           c+ 2d+ 3e= 25
              2d+ 9e= 46
              3d+  e= 19
```
