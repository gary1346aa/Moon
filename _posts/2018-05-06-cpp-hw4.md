# 1     Deciperhing Roman Numerals
Roman numerals is a number system used in ancient Rome to represent integer numbers. In this system, seven letters are used. The letters and their values are shown in the following table.

|Letter   |I   |V   |X   |L   |C   |D   |M  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Value   |1   |5   |10   |50   |100   |500   |1000   |

Note that there is no zero in the table since ancient Roman do not have the concept of zero. An integer represented in Roman numerals usually take more than one letter. In this case, the value is usually additive from left to right unless the letter on the immediate right has a larger value. In the latter case, the smaller value of the left letter is subtracted from the larger value of the right letter. Using this simple rule, some typical numbers are shown in the table below. 

|Roman numerals   |I   |II   |III   |IV   |V   |VI   |VII   |VIII   |IX   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Decimal values   |1   |2   |3   |4   |5   |6   |7   |8   |9   |

|Roman numerals   |X   |XX   |XXX   |XL   |L   |LX   |LXX   |LXXX   |XC   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Decimal values   |10   |20   |30   |40   |50   |60   |70   |80   |90   |

|Roman numerals   |C   |CC   |CCC   |CD   |D   |DC   |DCC   |DCCC   |CM   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Decimal values   |100   |200   |300   |400   |500   |600   |700   |800   |900   |


So you can use the above rule to solve `d` and `e` first, and than solve `c`, `b` and finally `a`. After finding the solution, please verify its correctness. That is, substitute the solution found to the left-hand side of the linear system and print out the right-hand side numbers. These numbers should match with those given above. The output of your program should have the following format:
```c
Solution:
  a=x b=xxx c=x d=x e=x
Verification:
  3a+ 4b+ 5c+ 6d+ 7e= 78
      2b+ 3c+ 4d+ 5e= 50
           c+ 2d+ 3e= 25
              2d+ 9e= 46
              3d+  e= 19
```
