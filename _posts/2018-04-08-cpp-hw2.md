# 1    Solving Linear System
A linear system is given below. please write a program to find its solution, using kramer's rule.

\\[ 
\begin{align*}
3a + 4b + 5c + 6d + 7e &=78\\
     2b + 3c + 4d + 5e &=50\\
           c + 2d + 3e &=25\\
               2d + 9e &=46\\
               3d +  e &=19\\
\end{align*}
\\]

Note that the solution of a two-variable system is known. For example, Given the system below

\\[
\begin{align*}
     ax  + by &=c\\
     dx  + ey &=f\\
\end{align*}   
\\]

The solution is

\\[
\begin{align*}
    x &= \frac{ce - bf}{ae - bd}\\
    y &= \frac{af - cd}{ae - bd}\\
\end{align*}
\\]

So you can use the above rule to solve `d` and `e` first, and than solve `c`, `b` and finally `a`.
